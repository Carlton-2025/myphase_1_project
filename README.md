OVERVIEW
With many different organisations coming up it is important for organisations to carry out research on the different types of products and equipment they have to interact with. 
BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
We were tasked with analysing a data set of aircraft crashes of different planes over the years from 1982-2022. The business investors were interested in knowing the risks of buying aircraft since they had no information on th types of aircrafts.
It is therefore our responsibility to do research on the different types of aircraft using the data set to know which are the riskiest and which are the safest.
DATA UNDERSTANDING
With the given data, it is evident that owning aircrafts is quite risky and may be costly to the investor.From this data set it recorded that over 88,000 airplanes have had accidents from the year 1982-2022.
DATA ANALYSIS
With this, we can deduce that the Cessna is the riskiet aircraft in the industry and should be avoided by all costs, followe by the Piper and the Beech. This is because they are the leading airplane risks in the market.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1.The organisation should avoid the Cessna, Piper and the Beech.
2.The organisation should make strict rules on how crewmates are to carry themselves while in transit.
3.The organisation should avoid the models 152,172 and the 172N models
NEXT STEPS
The organisation should go and conduct more research now on the most effective models and makes that will suit their needs.
